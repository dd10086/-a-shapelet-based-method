# MTSC
This code implements a multivariable time series classification method.


We use Python to implement the proposed method, and all experiments are run on the machine of Ubuntu system.


If you want to implement the code,please run it in Ubuntu system,Because there will be inexplicable errors when running on Windows system.

You also need create three folders:networks、losses、datasets，and then
put DC_GNN.py and initial.py in networks；
put loss.py and initial.py in losses；
put dataset file in datasets；



the folder structure as the image demostrate：

in addition, the wrappers_v2.py is another implements of wrappers.py. The difference lies in the different training methods of the model.
