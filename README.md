# MTSC
This code implements a multivariable time series classification method./n
We use Python to implement the proposed method, and all experiments are run on the machine of Ubuntu system./n
If you want to implement the code,please run it in Ubuntu system,Because there will be inexplicable errors when running on Windows system.
You also need create three folders:networks、losses、datasets，and then
put DC_GNN.py and initial.py in networks；
put loss.py and initial.py in losses；
put dataset file in datasets；
the folder structure as the image demostrate：
